                    <p>I like reading anything from poems to novel series to textbooks. Most recently I read all 50+ of H.P. Lovecraft's short stories.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy playing video games for fun (looking at you league of legends players) and enjoy most genres out there. I tried out starcraft II for the first time 2 weeks ago... It has a steep learning curve.</p>

                    <p>I infrequently go on math-binges so that the knowledge doesn't rust away up in the noggin. I've recently started reading a textbook dealing in real analysis - it has a lot of topics which have programmatical implementations.</p>
